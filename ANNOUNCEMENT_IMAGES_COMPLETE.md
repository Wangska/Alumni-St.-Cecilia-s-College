# Announcement Images Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Added

I've successfully added image upload functionality to announcements, so your News & Announcements section on the landing page can now display beautiful images!

### 🗄️ Database Changes

**Added `image` column to announcements table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE announcements 
ADD COLUMN image VARCHAR(255) NULL DEFAULT NULL AFTER title;
```

**Table Structure Now:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `title` - Announcement title
- **`image`** - **NEW!** Image filename (stored in `/uploads/`)
- `content` - Announcement content
- `date_posted` - Legacy date column
- `date_created` - Date created timestamp

### 📝 Form Updates

#### 1. **Add Announcement Form** (`announcements/new.php`)

**New Features:**
- ✅ File upload field for images
- ✅ Live image preview before submission
- ✅ Accepts: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP
- ✅ Recommended size guidance (1200x800px)
- ✅ Optional field (announcements can be created without images)

**How it works:**
- Admin selects an image file
- JavaScript shows instant preview
- Image is uploaded and stored as `announcement_xxxxxx.jpg` (random hex)
- Filename saved to database
- Image stored in `/scratch/uploads/` directory

#### 2. **Edit Announcement Form** (`announcements/edit.php`)

**New Features:**
- ✅ Displays current image (if exists)
- ✅ Option to change/upload new image
- ✅ Live preview of new image selection
- ✅ Replaces old image when new one is uploaded
- ✅ Keeps existing image if no new one is selected
- ✅ Deletes old image file when replaced

**How it works:**
- Shows "Current Image" if announcement has one
- Admin can upload a new image to replace it
- Old image file is automatically deleted
- New image is saved with unique filename

### 🎨 Landing Page Integration

The landing page (`index.php`) already displays announcement images:

```php
<!-- In each announcement card -->
<?php if (!empty($announcement['image'])): ?>
    <img src="/scratch/uploads/<?= htmlspecialchars($announcement['image']) ?>" 
         alt="<?= htmlspecialchars($announcement['title'] ?? 'Announcement') ?>" 
         style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
<?php else: ?>
    <!-- Fallback: Red gradient with icon -->
    <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center h-100">
        <i class="fas fa-bullhorn" style="font-size: 4rem; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.3);"></i>
    </div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

**Image Display:**
- **With Image**: Shows uploaded image (280px height, cover fit)
- **Without Image**: Shows red gradient background with bullhorn icon
- **In Modal**: Shows full-size image in announcement details

### 🔒 Security Features

1. **File Type Validation**: Only allows image formats
2. **Random Filenames**: Uses `bin2hex(random_bytes(6))` to prevent conflicts
3. **Secure Storage**: Files stored in `/uploads/` directory
4. **Old File Cleanup**: Deletes previous image when replaced

### 📸 Image Handling

**Upload Process:**
```php
// Generate unique filename
$uniqueName = 'announcement_' . bin2hex(random_bytes(6)) . '.' . $ext;
// Example: announcement_3f2a9b1c.jpg

// Store in uploads directory
$dest = __DIR__ . '/../uploads/' . $uniqueName;
move_uploaded_file($tmpName, $dest);

// Save filename to database
INSERT INTO announcements (title, image, content, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ...);
```

**Update Process:**
```php
// Keep existing image by default
$imagePath = $row['image'];

// If new image uploaded
if (new image) {
    // Delete old image
    @unlink(__DIR__ . '/../uploads/' . $old_image);
    
    // Upload new image
    $imagePath = $new_unique_filename;
}

// Update database
UPDATE announcements SET image=?, ... WHERE id=?;
```

### ✨ JavaScript Features

**Live Image Preview:**
```javascript
function previewImage(input) {
    if (input.files && input.files[0]) {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = function(e) {
            preview.src = e.target.result;
            previewContainer.style.display = 'block';
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(input.files[0]);
    }
}
```
