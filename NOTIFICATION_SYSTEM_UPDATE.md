# Notification System Update

## Overview
Updated the notification system to focus specifically on pending user approvals, making it more relevant and useful for admin users. The notification bell now shows the count of users waiting for approval instead of generic notifications.

## Key Changes

### 1. **New Notification Methods**
Added specialized methods in `NotificationManager` class:

```php
/**
 * Get pending user approvals count for admin notifications
 */
public static function getPendingApprovalsCount() {
    // Query to count unverified alumni users
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM users u 
         INNER JOIN alumnus_bio ab ON u.alumnus_id = ab.id 
         WHERE u.is_verified = 0 AND u.role = 'alumni'"
    );
}

/**
 * Get admin notification count (pending approvals)
 */
public static function getAdminNotificationCount() {
    return self::getPendingApprovalsCount();
}
```

### 2. **Updated Admin Layout**
- **Notification Source**: Changed from generic notifications to pending approvals
- **Direct Link**: Notification bell now links to User Accounts page (`admin.php?page=users`)
- **Contextual Tooltip**: Shows specific message about pending approvals
- **Real-time Count**: Displays actual number of users waiting for approval

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**
- **Relevant Notifications**: Only shows notifications that require admin action
- **Clear Purpose**: Users understand exactly what the notification means
- **Direct Access**: Clicking the bell takes admin directly to pending users
- **Visual Feedback**: Badge shows exact count of pending approvals

## Technical Implementation

### **Database Query**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM users u 
INNER JOIN alumnus_bio ab ON u.alumnus_id = ab.id 
WHERE u.is_verified = 0 AND u.role = 'alumni'
```

This query counts:
- Users with `is_verified = 0` (not yet approved)
- Users with `role = 'alumni'` (alumni registrations)
- Users who have associated `alumnus_bio` records

### **Notification Bell Updates**
```php
// Updated notification count source
$unreadCount = NotificationManager::getAdminNotificationCount();

// Enhanced tooltip with context
title="<?= $unreadCount > 0 ? $unreadCount . ' pending user approval' . ($unreadCount > 1 ? 's' : '') : 'No pending approvals' ?>"

// Direct link to user management
href="/scratch/admin.php?page=users"
```

## Benefits
