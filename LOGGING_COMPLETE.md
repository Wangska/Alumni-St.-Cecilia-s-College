# Activity Logging Implementation Complete âœ…

## Summary
All CRUD operations now log activities to the `user_logs` table and display in the Recent Activity section on the admin dashboard.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. âœ… Delete Button Issues Fixed
**Problem**: Events and Announcements showed "successfully deleted" message but data wasn't actually deleted
**Root Cause**: The delete.php files were looking for GET parameters (`$_GET['id']`) but the forms were sending POST data (`$_POST['id']`)
**Solution**: Updated both `events/delete.php` and `announcements/delete.php` to accept both POST and GET methods, with CSRF token verification for POST requests

### 2. âœ… Course Column Errors Fixed
**Problem 1**: Fatal error when adding courses - column `description` not found
**Solution**: Changed `description` to `about` (the actual column name in the database)

**Problem 2**: Fatal error when adding courses - column `date_added` not found
**Solution**: Removed `date_added` from the insert statement (column doesn't exist in the courses table)

### 3. âœ… Events Logging Added
- **Create**: `events/new.php` - Logs when new events are created
- **Update**: `events/edit.php` - Logs when events are updated
- **Delete**: `events/delete.php` - Logs when events are deleted

### 4. âœ… Announcements Logging Added
- **Create**: `announcements/new.php` - Logs when new announcements are created
- **Update**: `announcements/edit.php` - Logs when announcements are updated
- **Delete**: `announcements/delete.php` - Logs when announcements are deleted

### 5. âœ… Alumni Logging Added
- **Create**: `alumni/new.php` - Logs when new alumni are added
- **Update**: `alumni/edit.php` - Logs when alumni records are updated
- **Delete**: `alumni/delete.php` - Logs when alumni are deleted or rejected

### 6. âœ… Courses Logging Added
- **Create**: `admin.php` - Logs when new courses are added
- **Update**: `admin.php` - Logs when courses are updated
- **Delete**: `admin.php` - Logs when courses are deleted

### 7. âœ… Job Postings (Careers) Logging Added
- **Create**: `admin.php` - Logs when new job postings are created
- **Update**: `admin.php` - Logs when job postings are updated
- **Delete**: `admin.php` - Logs when job postings are deleted

### 8. âœ… Gallery Upload/Delete Fixed
**Problem**: Fatal error when uploading gallery images - columns `img_path` and `date_created` not found
**Root Cause**: The gallery table only has 3 columns: `id`, `about` (filename), and `created` (datetime)
**Solution**: 
- Fixed column names in `admin.php` (both upload and add cases)
- Updated `views/admin/galleries.php` to use `about` instead of `img_path`
- Updated `views/admin/galleries.php` to use `created` instead of `date_created`
- Added logging for gallery uploads and deletions
- Fixed delete function to properly pass image filename

All actions will now appear in:
- The **Recent Activity** section on the dashboard (last 10 logs)
- The **Activity Logs** page (`admin.php?page=logs`) for complete history

## Database Schema
All logs are stored in the `user_logs` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_logs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(100),
    action_type ENUM('login','logout','create','update','delete','view'),
    action TEXT,
    module VARCHAR(50),
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    user_agent TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Logger Usage Pattern
```php
// Include the logger
require_once __DIR__ . '/../inc/logger.php';

// Log a creation
ActivityLogger::logCreate('Module Name', 'Item Name/Title');

// Log an update
ActivityLogger::logUpdate('Module Name', 'Item Name/Title');

// Log a deletion (fetch name BEFORE deleting)
$item = $pdo->prepare('SELECT name FROM table WHERE id=?');
$item->execute([$id]);
$itemName = $item->fetch()['name'];
// ... delete the item ...
ActivityLogger::logDelete('Module Name', $itemName);
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Add filtering by action type in Activity Logs page
- [ ] Add date range filtering
- [ ] Add export to CSV functionality
- [ ] Add user-specific activity views
- [ ] Add search functionality for logs
- [ ] Add log retention policy (auto-delete old logs after X days)
