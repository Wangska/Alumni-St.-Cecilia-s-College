# Alumni Status Column Update - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Changed

I've updated the **Alumni Management** table to replace the "Contact" column with a "Status" column that shows connection/verification status matching your design!

### 🎯 Changes Made

#### Table Header
**Before:**
```
| Avatar | Name | Course | Batch | Contact | Actions |
```

**After:**
```
| Avatar | Name | Course | Batch | Status | Actions |
```

#### Status Display Logic

**Verified Alumni** (status = 1):
- Shows green badge with checkmark icon
- Text: "CONNECTED" (uppercase)
- Style: Light green background with green text
- Icon: Circle with checkmark (Bootstrap icon)

**Pending Alumni** (status = 0):
- Shows "Not connected" in gray text
- These users remain in the "User Accounts" section for approval

### 🎨 Visual Design

**Connected Badge:**
```html
<span class="badge-modern bg-success bg-opacity-10 text-success">
    ✓ CONNECTED
</span>
```

**Styling:**
- Background: Light green (`bg-success bg-opacity-10`)
- Text: Green (`text-success`)
- Icon: SVG checkmark circle (12x12px)
- Display: Inline-flex with 6px gap
- Font: 11px, bold, uppercase
- Padding: 6px 14px
- Border radius: 8px

**Not Connected:**
- Simple gray text
- Smaller font size
- No badge background

### 📊 Status Logic

The system now checks the `status` field from `alumnus_bio` table:

```php
<?php if (($alum['status'] ?? 0) == 1): ?>
    <!-- Show CONNECTED badge -->
<?php else: ?>
    <!-- Show "Not connected" text -->
<?php endif; ?>
```

**Status Values:**
- `1` = Verified/Connected (shows green CONNECTED badge)
- `0` = Pending (shows "Not connected" and should be in User Accounts)

### 🔄 Workflow

1. **New Alumni Registration:**
   - Status = 0 (Pending)
   - Shows in "User Accounts" page
   - Shows "Not connected" if somehow in Alumni list

2. **Admin Approves Alumni:**
   - Status changes to 1 (Verified)
   - Moves to "Alumni Management" page
   - Shows "CONNECTED" badge

3. **Alumni Management Display:**
   - Only shows verified alumni (status = 1)
   - All show green "CONNECTED" badge
   - Clean, professional look matching your screenshot

### 📍 Files Modified

**File:** `views/admin/alumni.php`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Changed table header from "Contact" to "Status"
2. ✅ Updated status display logic to check `status` field
3. ✅ Added green "CONNECTED" badge with icon for verified users
4. ✅ Kept "Not connected" for unverified users

### 🎨 Design Matches Your Screenshot

Your provided screenshot shows:

- ✅ Green "CONNECTED" badge with icon

### 💡 Additional Notes

**Alumni Management Page:**
- Shows only verified alumni (controlled by `getVerifiedWithCourse()` method)
- All entries will show "CONNECTED" status
- Clean, consistent display

**User Accounts Page:**
- Shows pending alumni (status = 0)
- These users need admin approval
- After approval, they move to Alumni Management

### ✨ Visual Hierarchy

The table now provides clear visual feedback:

1. **Avatar**: Profile picture with red border
2. **Name**: Bold name with email below
3. **Course**: Red badge (danger theme)
4. **Batch**: Blue badge (primary theme)
5. **Status**: Green badge (success theme) for connected
6. **Actions**: Edit and delete buttons

### 🎯 Benefits

1. **Clear Status Visibility**: Instant recognition of connection status
2. **Professional Design**: Matches modern dashboard patterns
3. **Consistent Theming**: Green for success/connected
4. **Icon Support**: Visual checkmark for quick recognition
5. **Accessibility**: Good contrast and readable text
