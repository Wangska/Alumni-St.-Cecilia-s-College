   ```php
   // Fetches last 10 logs
   $recentLogs = ActivityLogger::getRecentLogs(10);
   
   // Passes to view
   'recentLogs' => $recentLogs
   ```

2. **Dashboard View** (`views/admin/dashboard.php`):
   - Displays logs in table format
   - Color-codes by action type
   - Shows user, action, module, time

3. **Logger** (`inc/logger.php`):
   - Automatically logs all activities
   - Stores in `user_logs` table
   - Retrieved by `getRecentLogs()` method
